# EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) Overview
## Data and Variables
### what are the datas?
Data are pieces of information about individuals organized into variables. 
By an individual, we mean a particular person or object.
By a variable, we mean a particular characteristic of the individual.

A dataset is a set of data identified with particular circumstances. 
### Variables types
Variables can be classified into one of two types: categorical or quantitative.
**Categorical variables** take category or label values and place an individual into one of several groups. 
**Quantitative variables** take numerical values and represent some kind of measurement.
## Scales of Measurement
There is a more precise method of categorizing variables: it is called scale of measurement. 
- Nominal(有实际意义的分类)
- Ordinal(序数的分类,第一第二第三...但不知道类别之间的差距有多大)
- Interval(there is no meaningful zero point,不存在实际意义的零点,如智商,智商可以为0但是没有实际意义)
- Ratio(a ratio variable uses numbers to represent the amount of a characteristic and zero represents the absence of the characteristic.)
