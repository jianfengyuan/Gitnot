## Data and Variables
### what are the datas?
Data are pieces of information about individuals organized into variables. 
By an individual, we mean a particular person or object.
By a variable, we mean a particular characteristic of the individual.

A dataset is a set of data identified with particular circumstances. 
### Variables types
Variables can be classified into one of two types: categorical or quantitative.
**Categorical variables** take category or label values and place an individual into one of several groups. 
**Quantitative variables** take numerical values and represent some kind of measurement.
## Scales of Measurement
There is a more precise method of categorizing variables: it is called scale of measurement.
